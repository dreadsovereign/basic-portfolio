    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <p>Hello. I'm Kamran. I am originally from Thousand Oaks, California, and I moved to Durham, North Carolina, in 2014. I have a bachelor's degree in Sociology from the University of California, Davis (Go Aggies!). I originally wanted to study law, but I was talked out of it. My background is mostly in Quality Assurance, but only on the manual side. I am hoping this program will help me learn some automation QA, though, if web design (front end and back end) is something I really like, I might stick with it.</p>

    <p>My hobbies include playing the drums, reading, video games, anime, hiking, building computers and tech in general. I've recently started getting into board games with some friends.</p>
